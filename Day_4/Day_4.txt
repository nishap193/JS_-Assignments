 1---- Create the Example for Logical Operators 
       //check js document
 
 2---- Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
 ----> a) = is used for assigning values to a variable, == is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable whereas === is used for comparing two variables,
            but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.
       b) = is called as assignment operator, == is called as comparison operator whereas It is also called as comparison operator.
       c) = does not return true or false, == Return true only if the two operands are equal while === returns true only 
           if both values and data types are the same for the two variables.

3---- How many operators do we have in JS ?
----> There are different types of JavaScript operators:
            Arithmetic Operators
            Assignment Operators
            Comparison Operators
            String Operators
            Logical Operators
            Bitwise Operators
            Ternary Operators
            Type Operators
4---- What is use of parseInt in js?
----> The parseInt() function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix (the base in mathematical numeral systems).
      console.log(parseInt('123'));
      123   //output

5---- Take input from user and find the odd and even number.
      //check js document
