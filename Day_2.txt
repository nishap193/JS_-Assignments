1. What are the differences between var, let and const?
-> var :- The "var" keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. It was introduced in the early days of the language and was the only way to declare variables for a long time.
   let :- The "let" keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6) and is used to declare variables that can be reassigned later. "let" variables are block-scoped, which means that they are only accessible within the block of code in which they are declared.
   const :- The "const" keyword was also introduced in ES6 and is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned later. "const" variables are also block-scoped and behave similarly to "let" variables in that respect. 

2. Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN.
-> undefined:- A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.
   not defined:- Typically refers to a variable that has not been declared at all.
   NaN (Not a Number):- Represents a value that is not a legal number .

3. What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?
-> Null :- Null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. 
   Undefined :- Undefined means a variable has been declared but has yet not been assigned a value.Use null when you want to explicitly represent the absence of a value.

4. What is execution context?
-> When the JavaScript engine scans a script file, it makes an environment called the Execution Context that handles 
   the entire transformation and execution of the code. 

5. What is the use of prompt in JavaScript?
-> The Javascript  Window prompt() method is used to display a dialog box with an optional message prompting the user to input some text. 
   It is often used if the userwants to input a value before entering a page. It returns a string containing the text entered by the user, or null.

6. Why JavaScript is a Dynamic Language?
-> JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that data types of variables are determined by the value they hold at runtime 
   and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them.
