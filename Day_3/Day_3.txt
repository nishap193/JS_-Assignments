1. Write the Code for all Data types.
-> check js document

2. What are the uses of JavaScript Operators?
-> JavaScript operators operate the operands, these are symbols that are used to manipulate a certain value or operand. Operators are used to performing specific mathematical and logical computations on operands.
   In JavaScript, operators are used to compare values, perform arithmetic operations, etc.

3. Explain the Assignment Operator.
-> The assignment operation evaluates the assigned value. Chaining the assignment operator is possible in order to assign a single value to multiple variables
   Example:-  If A = 10 and Y = A then Y = 10.

4. Explain the all Arithmetic Operators.
-> In JavaScript, arithmetic operators take numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and return a single numerical value.
   There are four standard arithmetic operators, addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
   Arithmetic OPerators are:-
   =>addition(+)         
   =>subtraction(-)
   =>multiplication(*)
   =>division(/)
   =>modulus(%)
   =>Exponentiation (**)
   =>increment(++)
   =>decrement(--)
   =>unary(+)
   =>negation(-)

5. What are the Binary Operators in js.
-> These operators require two operands for operation. If one or more than two operands are provided, such operators result in a syntax error.
        =>Arithmetic Operators
        =>Comparison Operators
        =>Assignment Operator 

6. Explain the Pre-Increment and Post Increment in js.
-> Pre-increment: The pre-increment operator (++) increases the value of a variable by 1 before using its value. 
   Here's an example:
   
   let num = 5;
   console.log(++num); // Output: 6
   console.log(num);   // Output: 6
   ------------------------------
   Post-increment: The post-increment operator (++) increases the value of a variable by 1 after using its value.
   Here's an example:

   let num = 5;
   console.log(num++); // Output: 5
   console.log(num);   // Output: 6
